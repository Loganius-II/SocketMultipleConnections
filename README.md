# Still a work in progress

## What does it do?
- Creates a socket server in which can host multiple clients connecting to the server
- This one functions as a "Chat room"
- Less boring stuff will be added
  

## TODO:
- Fix amount of connections detected
- Correctly use `try`,`except` commands to avoid connection/disconnection errors
- Troubleshoot storing of each user's names and info in the two lists
- Fix the name duplacate detector
- Add more admin commands

## What is to come:
- Use pygame to create a graphical interface (GUI) to the project

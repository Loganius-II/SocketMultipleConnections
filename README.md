## What does it do?
- Creates a socket server in which can host multiple clients connecting to the server

- Less boring stuff will be added
  

## TODO:
- ~~Fix amount of connections detected~~
- ~~Fix `try` and `except` commands to avoid errors~~
- ~~Troubleshoot storing of each user's names and info in the two lists~~
- ~~Fix the name duplacate detector~~
- Fix banning to where it refuses connections of addresses in the `banned_clients_list`
- Add more admin commands
- **ADD MORE COMMANDS****

## What is to come:
